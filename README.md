## [Fuel Calc](https://fuelcalc-glucosefructos-ratio-calulator.lovable.app/)

**Glucose:Fructose Ratio Calculator for Endurance Fueling**

### Core Concept

Enter internal sugar values (glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch) from Cronometer to find optimal fueling ratios for cycling, running, and triathlon.

### How It Works

1. **Input sugars:** Glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch, maltose, lactose, galactose, allulose
2. **Choose preset:** 1:0.80, 1:1, or 2:1 ratio
3. **Get action plan:** Calculator tells you how much glucose or fructose to add
4. **Optimize strategy:** Adds glucose or fructose to reach target while keeping existing amounts

### Using with Cronometer

1. Open Cronometer diary → **Trends** tab
2. Enable **Glucose**, **Fructose**, **Sucrose**, **Starch** in nutrient report
3. Copy gram values for meal/day/training window
4. Paste into calculator and pick preset
5. Follow action plan to add or swap sugars until you hit target ratio

### Sugar Types Explained

| Sugar | Description | Contribution |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Glucose** | Simplest form, absorbed via SGLT1. Primary fuel for muscles/brain during exercise. | 100% glucose side |
| **Fructose** | Fruit sugar via GLUT5 transporter. Runs independently, increases total carb oxidation. | 100% fructose side |
| **Sucrose** | Table sugar: 1 glucose + 1 fructose bonded together. | Split: 0.5g glucose + 0.5g fructose |
| **Starch** | Complex carb (long glucose chains). Digestion breaks down to glucose. | 100% glucose side |
| **Maltose** | Two glucose units linked. Rapidly broken down to glucose. | 100% glucose side |
| **Lactose** | Milk sugar: glucose + galactose. Galactose uses SGLT1. | 100% glucose side |
| **Galactose** | Single sugar in dairy/plants. Uses SGLT1 transporter. | 100% glucose side |
| **Allulose** | Rare, low-calorie sugar not metabolized for energy. | Excluded from ratio |

### Science Background

The glucose-to-fructose ratio is crucial for intestinal absorption:

- **SGLT1 transporters** move glucose, saturate at ~60–90 g/h
- **Adding fructose** activates GLUT5 transporter (runs in parallel)
- **Total carb oxidation** can reach 90–120 g/h
- **1:0.8 ratio** (current research) reduces GI distress vs older 2:1 standard while maximizing fuel availability

### Features

- **Real-time ratio calculation** with current vs target comparison
- **Action plan** with precise recommendations
- **Optimization strategy** that preserves existing intake
- **OCR support:** Upload or paste nutrition screenshots (Ctrl/Cmd+V) for automatic value extraction
  - 100% on-device processing (free forever, no image upload)
  - First scan downloads OCR engine once
- **Works with any nutrition tracker** that provides sugar breakdown
- **Handles edge cases** when glucose or fructose is zero

## FAQ

**Can I use Fuel Calc with apps other than Cronometer?**  
Yes. Any tracker or nutrition label listing glucose, fructose, sucrose, and starch will work.

**What if glucose or fructose is zero?**  
The ratio collapses to the available sugar only. The action plan recommends adding the missing sugar to reach target.

**Does Fuel Lens send my data anywhere?**  
No. All processing happens in your browser. Data only leaves if you explicitly export a backup, report, or AI context file.
